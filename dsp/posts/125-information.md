As we commemorate 125 years of Culture, Harmony, and Friendship, we’re bringing the celebration to Boise! Join us on Thursday, November 14, for an evening that’s all about reconnecting with the brotherhood, sharing stories, and marking this historic milestone together.

This is a special opportunity for Boise-area brothers to come together, reflect on our Fraternity’s 125 years of legacy, and look ahead at what’s next. Whether you're a current member or an alumnus, this is your chance to celebrate Delta Sigma Phi in your own backyard. Spouses and significant others are welcome to join us for this memorable evening.

We’re hosting events across the country, but there’s something extra special about celebrating here in Boise with brothers who have shared so much history together. If you know of others who’d like to attend, feel free to share this invite with them!
